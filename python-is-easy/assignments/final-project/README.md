# **Crazy Eights**

**Crazy Eights** is a two person card game that is easy enough for young kids to play and complex enough to keep older kids or adults having fun too. The goal of this game is to be the first person to get rid of all of the cards in your hand. 

To play **Crazy Eights** with two people, the dealer deals five cards to each player. The dealer then places the pack in the middle of the table to serve as the “stockpile.” The top card of the stockpile is turned face up and placed in a separate pile. This card is the starter. 

The player who did not deal begins play by placing one card face up on top of the starter pile. Each card played must match the card showing on the starter pile, either in suit or denomination. For instance, if a Jack of diamonds is the top card on the starter pile, either a Jack in any suit or a diamond of any kind may be played on top of it. If the starter card was a five of hearts, on the other hand, a player could play another five card or another diamond of any number on top of it.

If a player’s turn comes and they are unable to play on the starter pile, that player must draw cards from the stockpile until a play is possible or the stock is exhausted. That means you could end up drawing one card or, well, a lot more depending on your luck! If the stock runs out, the player must pass their turn. It’s also okay for a player to draw from the stock even if they already have a playable card in their hand. 

In this game, all eight cards are wild—hence the name “Crazy Eights!” This means that an eight of any suit can be played at any time, and the player may designate it as any suit (but not any number). The next player must play a card of the specified suit or an eight. The player who plays all the cards in their hand first wins the game.
